            <p>At long last you've found the dungeon entrance of Flerb!!!</p>
            <p>You stand before two tunnels. The one on your left is large and appears relatively dry. The tunnel on your right appears narrow and wet.</p>
            <button class="btn" id="button1-left">Left Tunnel</button>

          </div>
          <div id="story2-2">
            <p>You duck into the damp and narrow tunnel, blindly squeazing your way through the tight turns, cold water dripping down your neck. You stumble out into a short corridor and at the end there are two doors.</p>
            <p>The door on your right has a cold draft and soft light coming through the cracks in the frame. The door on your left is solid and heavy with no distinguishable features.</p>
            <button class="btn" id="button2-2-left">Left Door</button>
            <button class="btn" id="button2-2-right">Right Door</button>
          </div>
          <div id="story3-1">
            <p>It's too dark to go in the door on the left. You curse yourself for going dungeon hunting without a torch.</p>
            <p>The door on your right has a cold draft and soft light coming through the cracks in the frame. The door on your left is solid and heavy with no distinguishable features.</p>

          </div>
          <div id="story3-2">
            <p>You walk into a cold room with a torch burning on the wall. Your see a table with a sling-shot, two apples, and half a loaf of bread on it. You grab these items and stow them.</p>
            <button class="btn" id="button3-2-return">Return To Corridor</button>
          </div>
          <div id="story3-3">

          </div>
          <div id="story4-1">
            <p>You cautiously walk into the room with the torch held in front of you and are greeted with the sight of a giant ugly bat. It screeches loudly and dives at you, biting your face. You take 10 damage.</p>
            <button class="btn" id="button4-1-sling">Attack With Sling-Shot</button>

          </div>
          <div id="story4-2">
            <p>You load a marble into your sling-shot and let it loose, striking the bat square between the eyes. It falls to the ground in a heap.</p>
            <p>You look around the room and notice the opening of a tunnel on the opposite side.</p>
            <button class="btn" id="button4-2-tunnel">Enter the Tunnel</button>
          </div>
          <div id="story4-3">
            <p>You strike with the knife missing the bat. It deals you 10 more damage.</p>

          </div>
          <div id="story5-1">
            <p>This tunnel is longer than the ones before. As you walk you notice it has smooth uniform sides. You continue in an uninterupted straight line for many hours.</p>
            <p>Your journey has left you feeling tired and weak.</p>
            <button class="btn" id="button5-1-apples">Eat Apples</button>

          <div id="story5-2">
            <p>Your health has been replenished.</p>
            <p>You exit the long tunnel into a great cavern with a waterfall flowing into a small river. You see a staircase carved into the cliffside leading to the top of the waterfall.</p>
