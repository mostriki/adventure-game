            <p>At long last you've found the dungeon entrance of Flerb!!!</p>
            <p>You stand before two tunnels. The one on your left is large and appears relatively dry. The tunnel on your right appears narrow and wet.</p>
            <button class="btn" id="button1-left">Left Tunnel</button>

            <p>Moments after entering the ground gives way beneath your feet and you fall to your death. The people of your homeland will surely perish now.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="roomies" id="wet-tunnel">
            <p>You duck into the damp and narrow tunnel, blindly squeazing your way through the tight turns, cold water dripping down your neck. You stumble out into a short corridor and at the end there are two doors.</p>
            <p>The door on your right has a cold draft and soft light coming through the cracks in the frame. The door on your left is solid and heavy with no distinguishable features.</p>
            <button class="btn" id="button2-2-left">Left Door</button>

          <div class="roomies" id="wet-tunnel-end">
            <p>It's too dark to go in the door on the left. You curse yourself for going dungeon hunting without a torch.</p>
            <p>The door on your right has a cold draft and soft light coming through the cracks in the frame. The door on your left is solid and heavy with no distinguishable features.</p>
            <button class="btn" id="button3-1-right">Right Door</button>
          </div>
          <div class="roomies" id="cold-room">
            <p>You walk into a cold room with a torch burning on the wall. Your see a table with a sling-shot, two apples, and half a loaf of bread on it. You grab these items and stow them.</p>
            <button class="btn" id="button3-2-return">Return To Corridor</button>
          </div>
          <div class="roomies" id="wet-tunnel-torch">

          </div>
          <div class="roomies" id="bat-room">
            <p>You cautiously walk into the room with the torch held in front of you and are greeted with the sight of a giant ugly bat. It screeches loudly and dives at you, biting your face. You take 10 damage.</p>
            <button class="btn" id="button4-1-sling">Attack With Sling-Shot</button>
            <button class="btn" id="button4-1-knife">Attack With Knife</button>

          <div class="roomies" id="bat-room-sling">
            <p>You load a marble into your sling-shot and let it loose, striking the bat square between the eyes. It falls to the ground in a heap.</p>
            <p>You look around the room and notice the opening of a tunnel on the opposite side.</p>
            <button class="btn" id="button4-2-tunnel">Enter the Tunnel</button>
          </div>
          <div class="roomies" id="bat-room-knife">
            <p>You strike with the knife missing the bat. It deals you 10 more damage.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="roomies" id="long-tunnel">
            <p>This tunnel is longer than the ones before. As you walk you notice it has smooth uniform sides. You continue in an uninterupted straight line for many hours.</p>
            <p>Your journey has left you feeling tired and weak.</p>
            <button class="btn" id="button5-1-apples">Eat Apples</button>

            <p>Your health has been replenished.</p>
            <p>You exit the long tunnel into a great cavern with a waterfall flowing into a small river. You see a staircase carved into the cliffside leading to the top of the waterfall.</p>
            <button class="btn" id="button5-2-river">Follow River</button>
            <button class="btn" id="button5-2-stairs">Take Stairs</button>
          </div>

          <div class="roomies" id="stairs">
            <p>Before you take your first step you pause for a moment. Is that the sound of music you hear? You can't be sure, because the waterfall is roaring just a few feet away, but your curiosity grows as you cautiously take each step. When you finally reach the top of the stairs your torch immediately goes dark.</p>
            <button class="btn" id="feel">Feel Your Way Around</button>
            <button class="btn" id="return-river">Return to the River</button>
          </div>
          <div class="roomies" id="dark-stairs">
            <p>Panic stricken, you run your hands over the smooth walls, searching for the familiar feeling of a cold brass door handle. Nothing.</p>
            <p>You can hear feet shuffling ahead of you, but you're not sure how, since you never found your way out of the staircase.</p>
            <button class="btn" id="knife">Take Out Your Knife</button>
            <button class="btn" id="blind">Continue Blindly</button>

          <div class="roomies" id="light-stairs">
            <p>With nothing to see through the darkness and light to indicate the entrance of the staircase, your other senses take over. The music has grown even louder and the smell of wet fir takes hold of your nostrils.</p>
            <p>Then the sense of falling, a sharp pain. a loud snap, then nothing. Only darkness behind your eyelids.</p>
            <button class="btn" id="knife-fall">Open Your Eyes</button>
          </div>


          <div class="roomies" id="river">
            <p>Following the river you approach a lovely, placid pool.</p>
            <p> Across the pool a looming Prison gate piques your interest.</p>
            <p> Something gleams from within the sand of the shoreline.</p>
            <p>A mall rickety boat is anchored here.</p>
            <button class="btn" id="button6-1-search">Search Through the Shoreline</button>
