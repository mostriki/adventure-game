            <p>Before you take your first step you pause for a moment. Is that the sound of music you hear? You can't be sure, because the waterfall is roaring just a few feet away, but your curiosity grows as you cautiously take each step. When you finally reach the top of the stairs your torch immediately goes dark.</p>

            <p>With nothing to see through the darkness and light to indicate the entrance of the staircase, your other senses take over. The music has grown even louder and the smell of wet fir takes hold of your nostrils.</p>
            <p>Then the sense of falling, a sharp pain. a loud snap, then nothing. Only darkness behind your eyelids.</p>
