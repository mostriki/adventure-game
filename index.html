            <p>Before you take your first step you pause for a moment. Is that the sound of music you hear? You can't be sure, because the waterfall is roaring just a few feet away, but your curiosity grows as you cautiously take each step. When you finally reach the top of the stairs your torch immediately goes dark.</p>

            <p>Panic stricken, you run your hands over the smooth walls, searching for the familiar feeling of a cold brass door handle. Nothing.</p>
            <p>You can hear feet shuffling ahead of you, but you're not sure how, since you never found your way out of the staircase.</p>

          <div class="roomies" id="light-stairs">
            <p>With nothing to see through the darkness and light to indicate the entrance of the staircase, your other senses take over. The music has grown even louder and the smell of wet fir takes hold of your nostrils.</p>
            <p>Then the sense of falling, a sharp pain. a loud snap, then nothing. Only darkness behind your eyelids.</p>

            <p>Following the river you approach a lovely, placid pool.</p>
            <p> Across the pool a looming Prison gate piques your interest.</p>
            <p> Something gleams from within the sand of the shoreline.</p>
            <p>A mall rickety boat is anchored here.</p>

          <p>The boat is shabby, but it holds together. You row across the pool and ascend the small embankment to the prison cell gate.</p>

          <div class="roomies" id="prison-cell">
          <p>The door of the prison-cell creaks loudly as you swing it open. You see a pile of dusty old rags in the corner, chains hanging from the ceiling and a chest next to the pile of rags.</p>
          <p>As you walk toward the chest, the rags shudder and begin to rise slowly, forming a body covered in loose pieces of torn cloth and skin with a wide, skeleton grin on it's grisely face.</p>
          <p>It lurches forward and claws at you.</p>
